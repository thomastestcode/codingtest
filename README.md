# Producer Consumer Pattern

This project is to implement a simple Producer/Consumer Pattern in Linux to sort input items from a file 
and write results into another file by using two simple sort algorithms (Selection and Bubble).

# Getting Started

Copy all files to your local machine for compiling the code to produce C++ executable file

# File List:

ProducerConsumer.cpp

build.sh  

CMakeLists.txt  

input.txt


# Compiling

$chmod 755 build.sh

$./build.sh

# Running the tests

Bubble Sort Algorithm:

$./bin/ProducerConsumer input.txt output.txt bubble

Bubble Sort Algorithm:

$./bin/ProducerConsumer input.txt output.txt selection
